3. **Display Product Sequence:** Displays the sequence of operations for each product currently in the manufacturing process.
4. **Dynamic Management:** Supports dynamic addition and removal of products and their associated manufacturing steps.
5. **Error Handling:** Includes error checking for invalid input and ensures proper handling of edge cases.
